title: Learning at Home or at Work
description: The debate about where to learn your craft focuses on the professional on the one side or the employer on the other. We should be considering their relationship instead.

When any **professional offers their services** for payment then they necessarily enter into a **two-way contract with their client**, either written or verbal. A written contract would set out the expectations of each party but many times it's partially assumed based on a (hopefully) **common understanding**. In any case its terms will vary according to the nature of the work being undertaken.

The [debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-prgMPHcOE) about when the professional software engineer should practice their craft, that is if it should be expected of the [*employer* to provide training](https://www.praqma.com/stories/2who-pays-for-upskilling-soft-developers/) or whether the *professional* should hone his skills outside of working hours, seems to neglect the fact that the *expectation* that the professional may have of their employer, or the employer of the professional, is **defined by their relationship, not by either individually**.

This is clear if we recognise that a single professional may have multiple relationships simultaneously with different clients, each with their own terms and expectations. The employer likewise, even more so.

For example, if you work as an employee for a company then you will have been employed with a given set of skills (ascertained by tests or interviews) for a given amount of hours to fulfil a specific job title. Your contract with the employer is literally that. You would (or should) not be expected to know things outside this agreement but your employer would have the right to use your working time as they see fit within that role. If that includes training then that is completely compatible with your contract, because you were not contracted for anything that you didn't already know. You can even **reasonably ask for that training** if you believe you need it to be effective in your role, it makes perfect business sense for you to be more effective. 

On the other had if you work as a freelancer then, in addition to your time, you will probably be contracted explicitly for some kind of **expertise** you can provide. It would probably be inappropriate, i.e. incompatible with your contract, for you to ask for training in that area of expertise. If, however, you need to work with some in-house software with which you have no experience and, importantly, **that expertise was not expected of you**, then here too training on the job is fully compatible with your contract.

Software engineers work with many different employers and clients in many different ways and to generalise this relationship leads to knife-edge thinking. We need to talk not not so much about the actors (professionals, clients, employers, etc.) but rather the **expectations and relationships between them**.
