It seems to be a theme of recent posts to go back over books I read more than two decades ago and realise how they formed an integral part of the way I think today{% sidenote explain "And, by realising where they came from, potentially help me to explain my thoughts to others." %}. 

Another such book was [Artificial Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2307953.Artificial_Life){% marginfigure artificial-life "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335347065l/2307953.jpg" "[Artificial Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2307953.Artificial_Life) (1992) by [Steven Levy](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32131.Steven_Levy) was a summary of the work done by visionaries like [von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann), [Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) and [Langton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langton) who, sometimes accidentally, studied complexity in simple rule based-systems." %}. 

I read this book when I was a teenager in the early to mid-nineties and I can still remember being awestruck by the ideas inside it{% sidenote game-of-life "One of which was the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) which I was proud to be able to reproduce on my Amstrad CPC. It has now become a popular [programming kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/GameOfLife/), but at that time was somewhat niche to say the least." %}. One of those ideas was that of complexity, not just in the every day sense of *very complicated* but in a new and very special sense. What really struck me was the idea of a *phase* of complexity between simple and chaotic where all the interesting stuff happens. Langton represented this idea in the following diagram:

![Lambda parameter](/assets/images/complexity/langton_lambda.png)

Here the Î» parameter is a kind of life and death measure of how a simple rule based system evolves. At low values the system might be static or periodic and easy to predict. At high values the system might become chaotic, essentially, noise. But at a certain point, if **given the right rules and the right initial conditions, complex patterns *emerge***. In fact it was later proved that some of the rules that he found in the complex region [*on the edge of chaos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_of_chaos) were exactly those that turned out to be Turing complete, that is able to reproduce any complex computation.

Stephen Wolfram (the creator of the Mathematica) a few years later published a mighty tome on this subject. [A New Kind of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science){% marginfigure artificial-life "assets/images/complexity/nks_cover.jpg" "[A New Kind of Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/238558.A_New_Kind_of_Science) (1997) by [Stephen Wolfram](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/139599.Stephen_Wolfram) a rather hefty and laborious read." %}, much of which based on his own [experiments](https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/universality-complexity-cellular-automata.pdf) performed in the 80s and his laborious work on a certain kind of one-dimensional cellular automa. But if he did get something right it was the title - this is a different way of looking at, not only science, but also the way we study any non-trivial system, from which the world, as it turns out, is mostly constituted. Reductionist analysis is not always enough.

Wolfram [classified his results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#Classification) into [4 separate behaviours](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p231--four-classes-of-behavior/), very similar to those rediscovered by Langton in his artificial life experiments.

![Classes of Cellular automa](/assets/images/complexity/ca_classes.png)

Class 1 and class 2 are the static and periodic phases. Class 3 chaotic and noisy. Class 4 the interesting complex behaviour, which again is where the Turing complete rules can be found.

Fast-forward to today and we have learnt and are continuing to learn how we are surrounded by these kinds of systems, in fact, we are part of such systems. 

Researchers are discovering how ants, bird flocks, social networks, biological reactions and any number of other phenomena display with [complex behaviours through self-interactions](https://www.quantamagazine.org/emergence-how-complex-wholes-emerge-from-simple-parts-20181220/). It turns out that we live and work with complexity everyday. Society itself sometimes seems chaotic but emergent patterns persist. Our built-in human behaviours seem to keep us in the sweet spot. Once again phase transitions appear spontaneously, and complex behaviour flourishes between the predictable and the chaotic.

At about the same time that Wolfram was publishing his book, [Dave Snowden](https://cognitive-edge.com/our-people/dave-snowden/) was creating the [Cynefin Framework](https://cognitive-edge.com/videos/cynefin-framework-introduction/). As we might expect, the framework has landscape with the same 4 classes, but this time applied to organisational principles:

![Cynefin Framework](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Cynefin_as_of_1st_June_2014.png)

Each *phase* in this framework has a set of techniques and methods which can be applied on a contextual basis. There is a clockwise drift associated with improved methods and experience and a counter-clockwise drift when knowledge is lost.

Interesting, [according to Snowden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4-vpegxYPg), agile organisations tend to be constantly on the phase transition between complex and complicated, in fact this is necessarily so: complex systems are where the interesting things happen but they are also unpredictable. Agile practices try to pull pieces from the complex phase, back into the complicated phase, or even into the obvious one, so that it can be treated in a single, small step, played-out and evaluated. This is what agility means.

Some algorithms are complicated and remain complicated. Machine learning is an example. This is the realm of the experts who can apply learned good practice and know when those practices may or may not be suitable.

Sometimes, however, the simplest projects are situated in the obvious phase already where waterfall techniques are perfectly adequate and true best practices possible.

So, from the Game of Life to the Cynefin framework we have seen how systems theory and, in particular, complexity help understand the world around us. Reductionist and one-size-fits-all arguments, pervasive in our industry, don't always hold. The landscape that this provides us helps (me at least) map out and simplify the complex systems in which we find ourselves, including in our everyday lives and the projects we work on, and respond in an appropriate, non-dogmatic way.
