In the rural community where I grew up there was a common aphorism: "*A good farmer has good gates*" and generations of experience showed that this is a pretty good rule of thumb. 

If you took a group of researchers and surveyed the local farmers' general habits, including how well maintained their gates are, do you think they could infer a relation? Could they even **predict** which were the better farmers based on their gates? Yes they probably could, because *a good farmer has good gates*.

In the jargon, this is *predictive inference*, and it is the kind of inference that _Accelerate_ describes{% sidenote chapter12 "In chapter 12 they go into some detail." %}.

Does having good gates *make* you a good farmer? Of course not. The relation between gates and the type of farmer is **not causal**.

Can a farmer become a better farmer through better maintenance of his gates? Hmm. _Accelerate_ might say that "good gates _drive_ good farming". IMO the word "drive" is bearing quite a lot of weight to make that statement.

The unfortunate situation is that predictive inference explains nothing. It may validate a hypothesis based on a theory but the scientific literature is littered with such validations that later turned out to be false{% sidenote phack "Try [this website](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/) to demonstrate your political point." %}. 

For explanation you need, at least, *causal inference* and that is much much harder. Causal inference requires a causal statistical model which is notoriously hard to get right.

My feeling is that some of the key indicators in _Accelerate_ really are causal but others are just the equivalent of good gates.
