A fallacy related to the [False Dilemma](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/94/False-Dilemma) and the [Half Truth](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/65/Cherry-Picking) but not really the same as either, the [*illicit negative*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_conclusion_from_a_negative_premise) is everywhere.

Take for example the statement "*I believe God exists*". We often implicitly or explicitly assume it has only one possible negative, "*I don't believe God exists*". 

There are, in fact, three alternative statements:
- I have no belief that God exists (weak atheism, or, sometimes, agnosticism, especially in the UK) 
- I believe that God does not exist (strong atheism)
- I have no belief that God does not exist (An even weaker form of agnosticism form of agnosticism but as rational a statement as any other)

We can look at which of these statements are mutually exclusive (hint: the affirmative ones) but in any case, in many arguments about God (for example on Twitter or Quora) these distinctions will likely be forgotten. The reactions to David Mitchell's [explanation of his agnosticism](https://youtu.be/xA85LVmqg0M) are a good example of this happening.

These failures of logic, called logical fallacies, are everywhere from politics to family arguments. Take this [famous exchange](https://youtu.be/NfFrW4yDubc?t=10) between Will Self and Mark Francois:
> Will: your problem, Mark, is not that you have be a racist or an anti-semite to vote for Brexit, it's just that every racist and anti-semite in the country did.

> Mark: I think that's a slur of 17.4 million people [who voted Brexit].

We have a politician provoked into mixing up the negative forms of a statement to reach a non sequitur that makes the conversation valueless to the point of being funny. 

Once you start thinking about it, [confusion of the inverse](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Confusion_of_the_inverse) is everywhere.
