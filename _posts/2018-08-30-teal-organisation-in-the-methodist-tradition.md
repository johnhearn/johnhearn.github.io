My parents are practicing Methodists, just as their parents before them, and I was brought up in a deeply Methodist tradition. Reading{% marginfigure "reinventing-organizations" "assets/images/reinventing-organizations-book.jpg" "[Reinventing Organizations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20787425-reinventing-organizations) by Frederic Laloux" %} about the traits of different organisational patterns in the book "Reinventing Organizations", although the author considers religious organisations to be generally Amber-Conservative, the similarities between the Teal-Evolutionary and the traditional organisation of the methodist church are stark.

The community is divided nationally into *districts* and then *circuits*. A single circuit may contain 20 or more local churches.

The active members of each local church, which may number in dozens, bear a striking resemblance to a *team*, as discussed by Laloux. They are responsible for all front-line activities like fundraising initiatives and church building maintenance and decoration and a myriad of other tasks. Members may spontaneously come together to organise some activity with complete autonomy.

Any important decisions at this level are discussed at church meetings and agreed by consensus. Everyone is welcome to participate. The chairperson and secretary of these meetings are usually volunteers, again agreed by consensus, and rotate organically.

At circuit level a Reverend and a small number of ministers{% sidenote "?" "what's the correct word?" %} could be considered the *staff* of the organisation. They number in single figures and perform high-level administration. The Reverend and other ordained ministers perform weddings, funerals, home visits and such like.

Representatives of the local churches, again volunteers agreed by consensus, will attend circuit meetings. Once more, special roles within the circuit are filled by volunteers and agreed by the same process.

When problems present themselves such as special efforts for charity, unexpected expenditure for maintenance{% sidenote "operational-risk" "Known as '[Operational Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_risk)' in the banking sector." %}, etc. then the local churches may ask the circuit for help or guidance. In turn, the circuit may ask the district for help, and so on{% sidenote "queen" "Not sure where that ends, probably with the Queen or something." %}. Nonetheless, it remains the responsibility of the local church itself to ultimately solve the problem, even it that means making some very hard decisions.

It's interesting to note that there are few elections, this is not typically a democratic organisation.

It must be understood that new ideas must be "sold" to other members of the community for consensus to be reached. It is also necessary to accept (and be able to accept) the consensus even when it may not suit you personally{% sidenote "acquiesce" "Acquiescence" %}.

Although the church is experiencing a decrease in participation, this model has worked for decades. I believe that its success can be put down to multiple factors:

1. A willingness, indeed eagerness, to reach consensus. This is generally in the sense of an openness to assist others in their efforts but may also mean giving up amicably on an idea which is not well received.
2. Autonomy at the front-line, a personal sense of responsibility to "do your bit" and a general sense of generosity of spirit to help maintain the community.
3. Some social/peer pressure to be seen to participate.

This kind of organisation feels "right" to me, maybe because of the upbringing I had. Maybe it's a model with a future.
