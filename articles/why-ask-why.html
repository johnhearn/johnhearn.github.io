      <h1>Why ask why?</h1>
<div class="subtitle">March 10, 2019</div>
<div class="smaller">three minutes.</div>

<p>Watching the film <em><strong>Triple Frontier</strong></em> on Netflix the other night (spoiler):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Santiago - <em>“Tom died for this money. Will you do it for him?”</em><br />
Benny - <em>“He didn’t die for that money, he died because of it.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So <em><strong>why</strong></em> did Tom die?</p>

<p>When I hear the word <em>why</em> I still remember being surprised to discover that in Spanish it has (at least) two different translations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first, “<em>por qué?</em>”, is related to mechanisms or preconditions from which some event was brought about. For example “<em>why did the cat fall out of the window?</em>”. There is no implication of intent but is rather asking about the circumstances leading up to an event. The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">5 Whys</a>” technique is an example of asking this kind of question.</li>
  <li>The second, “<em>para qué?</em>”, is about what is expected to be achieved by doing something - as in “<em>Why did you throw the cat out of the window?</em>”<label for="cat-window" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="cat-window" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">No cats were harmed in the making of this post. </span>. It’s about the purpose or intention of an action, an active voice.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s a subtle distinction and often forgotten in daily conversation but there are many examples. Compare the very different meanings of the question “<em>why did you go to the supermarket?</em>” with “<em>why did you go to <strong>that</strong> supermarket?</em>”.</p>

<p>Is it important or even interesting? Well, I think it is when reflecting about the choices we make.</p>

<p>If the reason you work where you do is because the office is close to your house then that’s a passive reason. On the other hand if it’s because it’s a job which fits with your interests and goals then that is an active reason<label for="wardly" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="wardly" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Simon Wardley breaks it down further and has <a href="https://blog.gardeviance.org/2016/11/how-to-master-strategy-as-simply-as-i.html">two types of active why</a>:  (1) why of purpose, and (2) why of movement. The first is strategic and the second tactical, the latter typically <em>instrumental</em> to the first, for example winning the chess game vs moving the piece. Both these are active whys. </span>.</p>

<p><strong>Modern life seems to want to encourage active whys all the time</strong>. Business and project management are full of examples of this. Productivity techniques are always asking for goals and objectives. It’s kind of stressful.</p>

<p>On the other hand many people live their entire lives with passive whys. Some actively (and ironically) strive for it.</p>

<p>Back when I was a teenager, many many years ago, listening to some music with a friend, I suggested that some new song was nothing more than mindless noise. He said: “Not mindless, maybe senseless” and continued smoking his joint. He was right, of course, someone had spent a good deal of effort to create that noise, probably spending many hours in the studio not even counting the years learning the instruments, the editing equipment, etc. I guess that he spent that time because he wanted to and what other reason does he need?</p>

<p>I just completed a <a href="https://www.edx.org/es/course/conscious-mind-philosophical-road-trip-trinityx-t004x-0">short course</a> in phenomenology. Why? Will it be useful in my daily work? No. Will it help me make dinner tonight? No. I did it because I wanted to, and although that is a passive reason, for me it’s good enough. <strong>Expanding horizons, learning new things just because you want to is fine if done in moderation. Maybe that’s a kind of active why after all</strong>.</p>

<p>Like everything the key is balance. Active whys need to be balanced with passive ones. We are humans, not robots.</p>

<p>A paradox of modern life - take charge of your life but go with the flow.</p>

<p>I hope you find the right balance.</p>
