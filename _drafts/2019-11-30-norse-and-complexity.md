During the middle ages Norse culture was spreading around the edges of northern Europe. It was mostly done through Viking hit and run style raiding but they also permanently colonised many areas and in fact very nearly made what is now England their own if wasn't for a very lucky Alfred the Great who managed to turn it around at the 11th hour. {% marginnote influence "The English language and the English people still exhibit signs of that influence even to this day." %}

It's interesting to compare how the Norse culture differed from Anglo-Saxon and in ways which are illustrative of modern ideas of complexity.

The first example is how they organised themselves. While Anglo-Saxon and similar cultures tended to have large kingdoms which were, by definition, headed by kings, the Norse tended to have smaller social groups lead by warrior chiefs whose affiliates were less driven by patriotism and more by loyalty and the success and wealth that could come from their Viking exploits.

What they might have lacked in structure compared to the larger kingdoms, they made up in the ability to move quickly, making-and-breaking allegiances, and the emergent behaviours that would come of that - raising Great Armies one day and in-fighting and rivalry the next. It's what we might call today bottom-up, or organic, organisation as opposed to the top-down, hierarchical organisation of the Anglo-Saxons.

Of course this is a gross oversimplification of the situation, both styles of organisation lived side by side, as they always do. Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were broken or amalgamated by wars and politics, Norse culture had internal hierarchical social strata. Part of the difficulty with thinking about complexity is that clear black and white separations disappear.

{% sidenote prefer "It is noticeable, however, that modern thinking *tends* to prefer the top-down approach, the bottom-up being less amenable to control. I also think it's related to the exam based education system but that's a topic for another day." %}

In the middle ages, Norse culture had a system where warrior prowess was displayed by the number of rings worn on their arms (this is a gross simplification but go with me). When one warrior defeated another, the winner took the rings of his opponent and added them to his own. In some way the number of rings would be like the collective encoding (1:11:00) of a warriors individual strength. If you run this out then most of the rings will be always held by a small number of individuals, who in this case would be the leaders rather than policers, who have a disproportionate amount of power (1:04:29).
Similar reasoning applies to todays social media "influencers".
