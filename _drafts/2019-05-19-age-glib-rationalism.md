description: Rationalism is the mainstay of the modern world but they forgot to teach us how we're wrong, what we don't know and how to live with uncertainty.

{% newthought "We live in an age of enlightenment values, logic and reason, a golden age of rationality with vast bodies of information at our disposal." %}

We're taught all that, but **we're not taught how to be wrong, what we don't know, that there are options and trade-offs, that there are things we can't know and how to live with that uncertainty**.

# Science

The success of the scientific method and enlightenment values is becoming a weakness. We are living in a time not just of science but of *scientism*, a misguided and dogmatic belief that *science*, whatever that is{% sidenote positivism "Likewise a related prevailing idea today is that of logical positivism, but let's keep it simple." %}, is the ultimate path to truth, without regard for its limits and subtleties.

Even those who shun science itself will take refuge in rational argument and logic. What can possibly be wrong with that?

## Coherence

Evidence is necessary but not sufficient for a valid argument. **An argument or hypothesis may be coherent without being true**.

Another form of this style of thinking is the incessant and unnerving tendency for people to insist that the view that they hold is true by virtue of its *coherence*. That is, because an opinion is rational and its conclusions follow logically from its premises then it is therefore probably, or even certainly true.

An example of that is the frequent criticism of teachers for questions [marked](https://imgur.com/gallery/KtKNmXG) [wrong](https://twitter.com/TRHLofficial/status/1128694323971874816/photo/1) even though the answer is ostensibly "correct". The coherent yet simplistic idea that a mathematical question like $$5+5+5$$ being the same as $$3+3+3+3+3$$ has a computationally unambiguous answer blinkers us from the possibility that the answer was not about calculation at all.

Another example from a speaker that I admire but [this slide](https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=605) also falls into the glib rationalism category:

> "We don't have time to do it right!" <br>
> "Do you have time to do it twice?"

The second sentence, as it appears on the screen, evokes a knowing chuckle from the audience, the implication being that it's obvious that doing it twice is silly, right? Well, no. I have experience of at least two scenarios where doing it twice is preferable to taking longer to do it once. That doesn't mean the thrust of the argument is wrong, just that there are more ways of looking at the situation which might lead to different conclusions.

And this is another difficulty, any criticism of a conclusion given as a certainty will, by the pendulum effect, often be considered as an argument for the opposite. This logical fallacy is everywhere. 

# Being rational

Ethnomethodological investigations into rationality. Rationality as specialised reasonableness or vice versa. DeepMind's AlphaGo as an example of statistical reasonableness masquerading as formal rationality.

# Decisions

The "correctness" of decision is based routinely on its outcomes rather that the information available when it was taken. Criticism is mostly in hindsight. 

Situations can generally be categorised into four different types:
- Predictable
- Hard to Predict
- Unpredictable but possibly explainable in hindsight
- Unpredictable and unexplainable, random

For any unpredictable phenomenon, like the economy, given enough predictions there is statistically a very high probability that someone will be right. That doesn't mean that they have made better predictions, just that they were lucky.

In a country where it rains once every 10 days on average, and there is a weatherman who is right 90% of the time on average. When he forecasts rain there is only a 50% chance of rain that day. 

Statisticians don't stop warning about the gross misunderstandings of statistics in everyday life. Taleb's [Black Swans](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0141034599) and silent evidence are examples. Nate Silver's "[Signal and Noise](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0141975652)" is another.

There is a deeper paradox. We know that there are lies, damned lies and statistics but nonetheless talk about what are essentially random fluctuations on the stock market as if it were some rigorous scientific field.
