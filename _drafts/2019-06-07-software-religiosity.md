This post is not intended to be provocative, just a reflection on my own personal experiences.

As a child I was expected to go to church every Sunday. My family and I would get dressed in our smartest clothes (our *sunday best*) and head along with others in our rural community to our local chapel{% sidenote church "Methodists, at least in this community not sure if it's universal, go to chapel rather than church. A chapel tends to be more scantly decorated and understated than a church. People from the Anglican community were referred to respectfully as “church people”." %}. The service would last around an hour during which there would be hymn singing, bible readings and almost certainly a 15 or 20 minute *sermon* where the preacher behind the pulpit (my Dad on occasion) would talk at length from the pulpit about some observation or other with reference to a corresponding verse of *scripture*, or vice versa. The best preachers were (are?) highly sought after for their inspiring insights, making the stage their own and travel the world to the pleasure of their congregations.

If we were lucky, the children were spared the sermon and left the service to go to Sunday School where we were introduced to similar content but with drawings and stories and games instead of rhetoric. Fun activities to keep us interested. Sound familiar?

After the service there was normally an equal amount of time devoted to socialising, catching up on the latest news, commentary about important events, births, deaths, illnesses and the like, planing for community activities, etc. etc. etc. As far as I can see, the whole affair had less to do with the religious aspects of the ceremony than it had to do with the organisation and bonding of the community. Nowadays we'd call that being *aligned*.

Fast forward to today and every time I go to a conference I get a certain sense of déjà vu. Lectures, some of which are distinctly evangelical in nature, are delivered from lecterns with evocative force. Certain speakers are highly in demand for their inspiring ideas and insights and travel the world by invitation. 

Between sessions we socialise and "network" with the community, discuss the latest news, share our experiences and look for new opportunities. Again, it seems like the community aspect of these conferences are as important or even more important than the content{% sidenote talking "I'm not sure what the psychological motivation is for some of us to want to speak in front of crowds but, at least for me, it seems that it is not solely commercial." %}.



Interestingly these same communities partake in *religious wars* and split into factions.

To be part of a community it is not necessary to believe all of its espoused values. In fact that would be impossible by the flaw of averages{% sidenote average-pilots "See this interesting article about [when U.S. air force discovered this flaw](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html)." %}. What *is* necessary is to be able to *accept those values* or be able to *challenge them on the community's own terms*.

I have discovered that you cannot challenge the validity of mathematics to a mathematician using philosophy. Likewise religion to a religious person based on logical argument. I have also discovered how hard it is to challenge some aspects of software development using wider experiences from other fields.
