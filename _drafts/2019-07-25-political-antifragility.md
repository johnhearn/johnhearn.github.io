[Anti-fragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility), as defined by [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb), is the *diametric opposite* of fragility. It means that a system{% sidenote system "in the general sense of a *system* of interacting parts."%} is not only able to withstand shocks, but also **directly benefits** from them{% sidenote vsresilience "Some detractors suggest that the word *resilient* already includes this possibility. Anti-fragility emphasizes the characteristic of actually embracing the possibility shocks occurring for total overall gain." %}.

One of his main examples is human bone. He provides several examples of high intensity increasing bone structure and strength. I'm reminded of the [study](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/29/prehistoric-womens-arms-stronger-than-those-of-todays-elite-rowers) which found that paleolithic women have greater upper body bone strength than moder day female runners. 

It seems that Taleb tries to apply the idea to himself: his brusque and sometimes offensive attitude on social media, for example, not only gains him more voyeuristic followers but also induces more people to talk about him and his ideas (and his book!) even when he's not personally involved. He makes no secret of this and very clearly describes how this works, even though some very intelligent people seem to [forget](https://twitter.com/snowded/status/1152888578290135040) it.

As another example take Boris Johnson or Donald Trump. They have been able to build a following where criticism is interpreted as whining or fake news from the political left. Both strengthen the resolve of their followers. Personal indiscretions are actually beneficial to their constructed personas, their volatility an endearing characteristic to the popular press. In the face of this political anti-fragility, it would require an enormous, unforced error (which we can only hope for and is actually not improbable) to loosen their support.

Some people from our own industry stand out as having created anti-fragile personas for themselves. One method they've used is to apply a kind of exaggerated humility, framing every statement as being potentially wrong, then whatever happens, they're right.
