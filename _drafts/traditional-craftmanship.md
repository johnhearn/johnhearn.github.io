My brother-in-law is a joiner, a wood craftsman if you like. Itâ€™s fascinating talking to him. He knows the strengths and weaknesses of every single kind of wood (cost, appearance, durability, etc.), and how to work with each one. He knows the importance of cost and deadlines and the trade-offs involved. He knows how to estimate a project, always mindful that his professional reputation is on the line.

A good friend on mine is an architect. He was offered a lucrative job renovating a property and told the client that a part of the structure was unsafe and needed strengthening. The client said the cost was too great. My friend refused the job on professional grounds. Some months later he found out that the roof had collapsed.

I worked on a very large software project with professional programmers and architects. It was doomed to failure and everyone knew it. It went live and caused chaos and stress for thousands of people. No-one questioned the professionality of those programmers or architects.
