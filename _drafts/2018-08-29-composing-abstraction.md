Linguists have a lot to say about this. Consider the following statement proposed by the renowned linguist Noam Chomsky:

> _Colourless green ideas sleep furiously_

Lack-lustre environmental proposals are dormant... no. There is a composition of abstractions here which, while grammatically correct, makes no actual sense.

> _To infinity and beyond_ - Buzz Lightyear

This is a composition of abstractions begetting another: *beyond infinity*. Together these abstractions also make no actual sense.
