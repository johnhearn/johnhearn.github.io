The [Tufte-Jekyll](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) theme is a natural extension of the work done by Edward Tufte and his collaborators on [Github](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) who created a CSS file that allows web writers to use the same simple and elegant style employed in his published materials.

The style uses liberal margin notes as an alternative to foot notes to bring additional detail closer to the relevant text.

Tufte is best known for his [analysis](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB) of PowerPoint slides used by NASA engineers leading up to the Challenger disaster. This was part of a general critisism of presentation style (PowerPoint/Keynote) slides as a tool for communication, suggesting that they tend to be used for persuasion rather that to inform. I have some sympathy for that view.
